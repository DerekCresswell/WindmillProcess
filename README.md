# WindmillProcess
A visualization of a question from the 2011 International Mathematical Olympiad

# Problem
Problem 2. Let S be a finite set of at least two points in the plane. Assume that no three points
of S are collinear. A windmill is a process that starts with a line ` going through a single point
P âˆˆ S. The line rotates clockwise about the pivot P until the first time that the line meets some
other point belonging to S. This point, Q, takes over as the new pivot, and the line now rotates
clockwise about Q, until it next meets a point of S. This process continues indefinitely.
Show that we can choose a point P in S and a line ` going through P such that the resulting windmill
uses each point of S as a pivot infinitely many times.

# Goal
The goal is to create a visualization like the one in the video on this problem by 3Blue1Brown (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M64HUIJFTZM).
Points will be able to be added by clicking and the program can react as you change it.
